		<h3>//ABOUT</h3>
		<p>My name is Jim. I'm a Creative Director, teacher and writer of various things. </p>
		<p>I've had the good fortune of working on famous brands with smart, kind, talented people. My work has been recognized at award shows, but I take the most satisfaction in making content that delights people in the real world.</p>
		<p>I also teach writing, concepting and storytelling classes and co-author a blog for students and juniors. I love to see young creatives realize their dreams. I can lead a department, lead a project, lead a new business pitch or work as a solo copywriter. I can work with an agency team, imbed at a client, lead multi-agency collaborations or any mix of the those. Short term, long term, strategy through execution, I'm up for anything. My goal is simple: to make great work with great people. </p>
		<p>Thanks for stopping by. Please reach out if I can help in any way.</p>
