					<td style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 2">As most of you know, my kid suffers from pretty extreme asthma. Especially this time of year, and especially during soccer. I've been poking around looking for other athletes who suffer from asthma. My buddy Dave was like, "Dude, Darth." Wasn't quite what I had in mind, but my son was totally inspired. If a guy with asthma can rule over the empire, he can do anything.</td>

					<td style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 2">This is my buddy, Dave. He's exactly how he looks: total d-bag. (Sorry, Dave, I call 'em how I see 'em.) Anyway, the sick car there? Rolls. Not Dave's Rolls. And while Dave's taking this pic, the owner walks up. Ancient dude with dark sunglasses and a beautiful woman on his arm. Blind... visually impaired. So Dave, living up to his rep, mumbles under his breath, "Christ. Can't even see to appreciate it." Which the guy of course hears. He turns to Dave and says, "She's my daughter, you jackass." How's that foot taste, David?</td>

					<td style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 2">This is not my buddy Dave. This is my hero, David Lynch. I just heard that he finally signed on to direct the reborn season of <i>Twin Peaks.</i> That show (and this is not just my humble opinion, it is a fact) was the greatest thing ever on network television. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and give it a watch. Season I is amazing. Season II drops it a little at the end, but that's what happens when the network makes you wrap up 35 random plots in a couple weeks. Hope the new season lives up to the legend.</td>
